# Lit review on the relationship between voting systems and confidence

[MEDSL: Voter Confidence (general explainer)](https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/voter-confidence) (2021)
- Relationship between voter confidence and turnout is weak
- Now clear causal links between administration practice (like voter ID laws) and voter confidence. (Presumably lower-profile changes like voting systems would have even less effect.)
- Voter confidence is better explained by
  - whether a voter's favored candidate won
  - the experience of casting a ballot
- overall confidence that a respondent's "vote was counted as intended" has dropped or been relatively stead (70% -> 67%) since 2000 despite technology/verifiability improving. 
- "It's common to justify election reforms by arguing they will increase voter confidence in the electoral system. However, there's little evidence that election administration has a direct effect on voter confidence. The major exception to this statement is that voters who experience problems at polling places tend to be less confident than voters who don’t."
- Conclusion: Changes to admin do not necessarily result in a change in confidence. May even backfire if the conversation is polarized along partisan lines.
- "Research by scholars such as Lonna Atkeson, Mike Alvarez, Thad Hall, and Paul Gronke tells us that voters tend to be more confident when they don’t wait a long time to vote, when they encounter polling place officials who seem competent, and when they vote in person rather than by mail."

[Coll: Securing Elections, Securing Confidence? Perceptions of Election Security Policies, Election Related Fraud Beliefs, and Voter Confidence in the United States](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/elj.2023.0024?download=true&journalCode=elj) (2024)
- The effect of "election security policies" (practices that prevent, monitor for, and prosecute fraud) on confidence is not well understood
- Issues with studying this: can't assert causality. Questions of who thinks the policies are in place, who thinks they are effective, and correctness about presence and effectiveness of ESPs.
- Mixed evidence that voter ID requirements affect voter beliefs and confidence. When they do, there are partisan asymmetries.
- Mixed evidence on whether auditing increases or decreasing confidence. Mixed evidence on effect of monitors.
- (No mention of studies about voting systems.)
- Voters are generally unaware of the voter ID and audit policies in their states. "If citizens are unaware/incorrect about what policies their state employs, using indicators of what policies are in use will not capture citizen perceptions of the security of their eletions. Instead, researchers must consider what policies the respondents perceive to be in place.
- They hypothesize that ESPs that do not relate to voter access (like voting machines -WA) should not be partisanly polarized.
- Their data comes from SPAE
- SPAE asks about whether voters know about various practices. None are about machines directly.
- Study relates perceived presence of practices to confidence and fraud beliefs
- ESPs decrease fraud beliefs and increase confidence. Need to believe that there are several ESPs in place
- The most impactful policy for reducing fraud beliefs is "safely storing ballots." Least influential is "partisan poll workers."
- Most impactful policy for voter confidence is "pre-testing machines." (boosts pr(very confident votes counted as intended) by 8.58 pp.)
- Most do not believe their state employs many ESPs but they do increase legitimacy. Effects are small, and no single policy matters much. One way to increase confidence is simply to inform voters about the steps EOs take to secure elections.
- TODO: follow and expand a few references here

King (2017, 2020):
- Greater performing poll workers and better administered polling places can increase confidence
- Longer waits to vote can decrease confidence (see also Atkeson and Saunders, 2007; Hall et al, 2009)

[SPAE writeup](https://electionlab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-05/How-We-Voted-In-2022.pdf) (2023):
- "The results on ["how confident are you that your vote in the general was counted as intended?"] have been virtually unchanged over the past two decades."
- TODO: fill out more

- 2022 SPAE: voters are more confident when they believe their state or locality employs more and more effective ESPs. But effect of any single policy seems to be limited

Outstanding Q to justify study: How much do EOs spend on voting systems? Is it a substantial cost? That would raise importance.
Advantage/disadvantage to our study: Use a dataset on actual data/practices, not just beliefs.
